# The Cyber Threat Intelligence Lifecycle

The cyber threat intelligence lifecycle is a cyclical process to continuously improve threat analysis and defensive measures. It comprises the following phases:

1. **Planning & Direction:**  
   Define intelligence requirements and objectives based on operational needs.
   
2. **Collection:**  
   Gather raw data from various sources, including OSINT, internal logs, and threat feeds.
   
3. **Processing:**  
   Organize and format the collected data, filtering out irrelevant information.
   
4. **Analysis:**  
   Correlate, interpret, and contextualize the data to produce actionable intelligence.
   
5. **Dissemination:**  
   Distribute intelligence reports to stakeholders and incident response teams.
   
6. **Feedback:**  
   Review intelligence effectiveness and refine the process.

This lifecycle ensures that intelligence operations are systematic, timely, and continuously improving.
