# Key Concepts in Cyber Threat Intelligence

This document outlines the foundational concepts in cyber threat intelligence:

- **Threat Intelligence Lifecycle:**  
  A structured process that includes planning & direction, collection, processing, analysis, dissemination, and feedback.

- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**  
  Artifacts such as IP addresses, domain names, file hashes, and URLs that signal potential attacks.

- **Threat Actors & Attribution:**  
  Identifying and attributing attacks to specific adversaries using frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK.

- **Data Sources & Fusion:**  
  The gathering of data from OSINT, commercial feeds, internal telemetry, and threat-sharing platforms.
