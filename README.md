# CyberThreat-Intel-Overview

## 1. Project Goal & Overview

**CyberThreat-Intel-Overview** is a GitHub repository designed to serve as an all‑in‑one portfolio for my cyber threat intelligence knowledge. This repository functions as both:

- **An Educational Resource:**  
  Detailed documentation covering key concepts, case studies, and curated research articles related to cyber threat intelligence.
- **A Practical Tool:**  
  Sample Python scripts demonstrating the threat intelligence lifecycle—from the collection of threat data to the analysis and reporting phases.

**Target Audience:** SOC Level 1 analysts, cyber threat intelligence professionals, and anyone interested in understanding and applying threat intelligence methodologies.

## 2. Core Components & Functionality

- **Threat Intelligence Documentation:**  
  - *Key Concepts & Frameworks:*  
    See `docs/Key_Concepts.md` for foundational terminology and concepts.
  - *Case Studies:*  
    Real-world examples and lessons learned are documented in `docs/Case_Studies.md`.
  - *Curated Research Articles:*  
    Essential whitepapers and research articles are compiled in `docs/Research_Articles.md`.
  - *The Intelligence Lifecycle:*  
    Detailed explanation of each phase (collection, processing, analysis, dissemination, feedback) in `docs/Intelligence_Lifecycle.md`.

- **Practical Scripts:**  
  - *Data Collection:*  
    `scripts/data_collection.py` simulates fetching threat data from public feeds.
  - *Data Analysis:*  
    `scripts/data_analysis.py` demonstrates how to process and analyze the collected data.

## 3. Getting Started & Installation

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Git

### Installation:
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Barrosleo/CyberThreat-Intel-Overview.git
   cd CyberThreat-Intel-Overview
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
  ```
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt  # (If you add a requirements.txt later)
  ```

## 4. Usage Examples

### Running the Data Collection Script:
  ```
  python scripts/data_collection.py
  ```
This simulates the data collection phase and prints dummy threat indicator data.

### Running the Data Analysis Script:
  ```
  python scripts/data_analysis.py
  ```
This script reads sample data from examples/sample_data.json and outputs an analysis report.
